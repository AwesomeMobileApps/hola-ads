# Â¡Hola! - Just Simple Meteor Project :smiley:

Just a very basic project created with the Node.js framework "[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com)" and using Bootstrap for the frontend. Just done it for fun (playing with it) without spending too much time on the project!  

It doesn't do anything very special. Just a very simple classified app. Allowing to add/remove classifieds (without checking any kind of validation/XSS/ or other security stuffs).


## Requirements

Your server needs [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed
